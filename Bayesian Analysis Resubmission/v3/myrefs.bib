	Abstract = {Life table methods are developed for populations whose members differ in their endowment for longevity. Unlike standard methods, which ignore such heterogeneity, these methods use different calculations to construct cohort, period, and individual life tables. The results imply that standard methods overestimate current life expectancy and potential gains in life expectancy from health and safety interventions, while underestimating rates of individual aging, past progress in reducing mortality, and mortality differentials between pairs of populations. Calculations based on Swedish mortality data suggest that these errors may be important, especially in old age.},

Three models are considered: the log linear exponential (Glasser [1967]); Cox's [1972] nonparametric generalization of this; and the linear exponential (Feigl and Zelen [1965]). Age and white blood count at diagnosis are both shown to be important for prognosis; adjustment for the latter variable has marked effects on the treatment comparisons. Both advantages and disadvantages with the regression approach are noted.},

abstract = {Abstract.  Bayesian analysis of time-to-event data, usually called survival analysis, has received increasing attention in the last years. In Cox-type models it allows to use information from the full likelihood instead of from a partial likelihood, so that the baseline hazard function and the model parameters can be jointly estimated. In general, Bayesian methods permit a full and exact posterior inference for any parameter or predictive quantity of interest. On the other side, Bayesian inference often relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques which, from the user point of view, may appear slow at delivering answers. In this article, we show how a new inferential tool named integrated nested Laplace approximations can be adapted and applied to many survival models making Bayesian analysis both fast and accurate without having to rely on MCMC-based inference.},

 ISSN = {0006341X, 15410420},
 abstract = {In studies of survival, the hazard function for each individual may depend on observed risk variables but usually not all such variables are known or measurable. This unknown factor of the hazard function is usually termed the individual heterogeneity or frailty. When survival is time to the occurrence of a particular type of event and more than one such time may be obtained for each individual, frailty is a common factor among such recurrence times. A model including frailty is fitted to such repeated measures of recurrence times.},

 abstract = {Spline and generalized spline smoothing is shown to be equivalent to Bayesian estimation with a partially improper prior. This result supports the idea that spline smoothing is a natural solution to the regression problem when one is given a set of regression functions but one also wants to hedge against the possibility that the true model is not exactly in the span of the given regression functions. A natural measure of the deviation of the true model from the span of the regression functions comes out of the spline theory in a natural way. An appropriate value of this measure can be estimated from the data and used to constrain the estimated model to have the estimated deviation. Some convergence results and computational tricks are also discussed.},
